1.12.8 (2017-03-27)
-------------------
* Remove old gazebo settings.
  Based on an initial patch from YoheiKakiuchi, just totally
  remove old Gazebo 1.0 settings, as they are never used and
  almost certainly will never be used.
* add Chris and Shane as maintainers (`#184 <https://github.com/ros/robot_model/issues/184>`_)
* Do a few cleanup tasks in collada_urdf (`#183 <https://github.com/ros/robot_model/issues/183>`_)
  * Style cleanup within collada_urdf.
  No functional change, just style.
  * Make sure to quit out of urdf_to_collada when invalid file is found.
  Otherwise, we'll just end up segfaulting later on.
  * Re-enable one of the collada-urdf tests.
  In point of fact, we delete the rest of the tests because
  they don't make much sense anymore.  Just enable this one
  for now; we'll enable further ones in the future.
  * Add in another test for collada_urdf.
* remove divide by 2 when writing boxes to collada format (`#133 <https://github.com/ros/robot_model/issues/133>`_)

  It looks like this API was added in Assimp 2.0.885:
  https://github.com/assimp/assimp/commit/ae23c03bd9a0b5f1227dc0042fd98f7206c770a8
* Invert Assimp version detect logic for greater accuracy
* Updated Assimp defines to be more flexible
  This commit is a follow-up to 85b20197671e142044e471df603debd0faf08baf
  Why was export.h removed from assimp < 3.0.0?
* Better feature detection for assimp version
  The unified headers were introduced in Assimp 2.0.1150, so checking for Assimp 3.0.0 is not quite the best solution.
